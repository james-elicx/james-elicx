<h3>Hey there! 👋🏻</h3>

I'm James, a self-taught software engineer from England. Passionate about all things frontend when it comes to web development, spending most of my time crafting user interfaces and innovative solutions to problems.

I enjoy taking ideas and projects and turning them into a reality, some of which end up being open-source.
